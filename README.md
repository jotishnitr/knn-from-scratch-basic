# KNN From Scratch (Basic)

This repository contains a simple implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm
written using basic Python only. No machine learning libraries are used.

## Description
The KNN algorithm classifies a test point by calculating distances from known points
and assigning the label that appears most among the nearest neighbors.

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Open the file `knn.py`.
3. Run the program using:
   python knn.py

## Language Used
Python
